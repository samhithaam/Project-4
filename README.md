///////////// to do: who submitted what on vocareum

There are 4 classes, Student, Teacher, Quiz and User. 

STUDENT CLASS: The Student class handles everything that a Student account should able to do, mainly taking a quiz or viewing their grades on a quiz. In this class, there is also a method that handles randomizing the order of the questions and then printing the questions in that random order for each student. 

TEACHER CLASS: The Teacher class handles the creation of all the quizzes. In this class, you can also edit and delete questions of the quiz. The grading of the quizzes is also handled in this class by assigning a certain number of points for each correct answer. 

QUIZ CLASS: The Quiz class handles printing the quiz that the teacher created in order for the Student to take it. 

USER CLASS: The User class handles creating, editing, and deleting account usernames/passwords, as well as signing into an account. 

Each of these classes works with each other in order create a working code that can create, edit and delete different accounts for students and teachers. The student and teacher accounts that are created have limitations on what they can do based on if it is a teacher or student account. Teacher accounts can create and assign quizzes, whereas the student account can only access and take the quizzes. 
/////// to do: where does randomization take place(quiz/teacher)
There is also a randomization method in the -------- class, which gives the teacher the option of presenting the quiz questions to the students in a random order.
